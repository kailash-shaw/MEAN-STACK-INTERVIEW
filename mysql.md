## ‚úÖ Part 1: Advanced SQL & Query Optimization

### 1. **How does the MySQL optimizer choose execution plans? How can you influence it?**

The MySQL optimizer is **cost-based**. It uses table statistics, index selectivity, join order, and estimated row count to choose the most efficient plan.

**You can influence it by:**

- Creating appropriate **indexes**.
- Using **EXPLAIN** and **ANALYZE** to monitor plans.
- Applying **query hints** (`STRAIGHT_JOIN`, etc.).
- Rewriting queries for clarity and performance.
- Updating statistics (`ANALYZE TABLE`).

---

### 2. **How do you analyze and optimize a slow query?**

**Steps:**

1. Use `EXPLAIN` to inspect execution plan.
2. Use `SHOW PROFILE` or `performance_schema` for detailed breakdown.
3. Check for:
   - Full table scans
   - Unused indexes
   - Large row count estimates
4. Optimize by:
   - Adding/selecting proper indexes
   - Limiting result set
   - Rewriting joins or subqueries
   - Caching or materializing results if reused often

---

### 3. **What are Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?**

CTEs (`WITH` clause) are temporary result sets that exist only for the duration of a query. They improve **modularity**, **readability**, and are required for **recursive queries**.

Use CTEs when:

- You need recursion (e.g., tree structures)
- The same subquery is reused
- Breaking complex logic into steps

---

### 4. **What is a covering index?**

An index that **includes all the columns** needed by the query. No need to look up the base table.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

**Covering index:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_cover ON users (email, id, name);
```

---

### 5. **How do window functions differ from GROUP BY?**

- `GROUP BY`: Aggregates rows ‚Üí 1 result per group.
- `Window Functions`: Adds calculation **without collapsing rows**.

**Use cases:**

- Ranking (e.g., `RANK()`)
- Running totals (`SUM() OVER (...)`)
- Differences across rows (`LAG()`, `LEAD()`)

---

## ‚úÖ Part 2: Indexing & Performance

### 6. **How do composite indexes work?**

A composite index is built on **multiple columns**. MySQL uses the **leftmost prefix**.

**Index (a, b, c)** can be used for:

- WHERE a = ...
- WHERE a = ... AND b = ...
- WHERE a = ... AND b = ... AND c = ...

Not for: `WHERE b = ...`

---

### 7. **Difference between BTREE and HASH indexes?**

- `BTREE` (default in InnoDB): Ordered, good for range queries.
- `HASH` (used in MEMORY engine): Fast equality lookups, **not** for ranges or ordering.

---

### 8. **Indexing strategy for high-write, low-read system?**

- **Minimize indexing** (each index adds write overhead).
- Use **only essential indexes**.
- Consider **partitioning** or **sharding**.
- Use **bulk inserts** and **batched writes**.

---

### 9. **What is index selectivity?**

Selectivity = `# of distinct values / total rows`

**Higher selectivity = more effective index**

Use `SHOW INDEX` to check cardinality or `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT col)`.

---

### 10. **How to find unused/duplicate indexes?**

- Use performance schema tables or:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sys.schema_unused_indexes;
  ```

- Use tools: **pt-index-usage** (Percona Toolkit)

---

## ‚úÖ Part 3: Replication, Backup, HA

### 11. **How does MySQL replication work?**

- **Master writes to binary log**
- **Replica reads binlog via I/O thread**
- **Applies via SQL thread**

Two modes:

- **Statement-based**
- **Row-based** (preferred for accuracy)

---

### 12. **GTID vs Traditional Replication**

- GTID = Global Transaction ID, unique per transaction.
- Simplifies failover, recovery.
- Enables **automated promotion** of replicas.

---

### 13. **Common replication problems and fixes**

- **Lag**: Monitor `Seconds_Behind_Master`
- **Skipped transactions**: Use GTIDs to re-sync
- **Data drift**: Use tools like **pt-table-checksum**
- **Replication broken**: Use `mysqlbinlog` to replay or `RESET SLAVE`

---

### 14. **How to handle failover in replication?**

- Use GTID + **orchestrator**, **MHA**, or **ProxySQL**.
- Automate promotion of replica ‚Üí new master.
- Ensure apps retry writes or use **read/write split**.

---

### 15. **Point-in-time recovery strategy**

1. Full backup with `mysqldump` or `xtrabackup`.
2. Enable binary logging.
3. To recover:
   - Restore backup
   - Apply binlog using `mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="..."`

---

### 16. **How to back up 1TB DB with minimal downtime?**

- Use **Percona XtraBackup** (hot backup for InnoDB).
- Use **replica for backup** to avoid load on primary.
- Use `--stream` to avoid full file copy to disk.

---

## ‚úÖ Part 4: Transactions & Concurrency

### 17. **Isolation levels in MySQL**

- `READ UNCOMMITTED`: Dirty reads
- `READ COMMITTED`: No dirty reads
- `REPEATABLE READ` (default): Phantom rows possible
- `SERIALIZABLE`: Full locking, most strict

Use `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...`

---

### 18. **MVCC in InnoDB**

- Multi-Version Concurrency Control lets readers read a **snapshot** while writers write.
- Uses **undo logs** and **transaction IDs**.
- Avoids locking reads ‚Üí boosts concurrency.

---

### 19. **Deadlocks: Causes & Fixes**

- Caused by **conflicting lock order**.
- Detected automatically, but fix by:
  - Always locking tables in **same order**
  - Keep transactions short
  - Monitor with `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`

---

### 20. **How to tune InnoDB for high transactions**

- `innodb_buffer_pool_size` = 70‚Äì80% of RAM
- `innodb_log_file_size` = large enough to reduce checkpoints
- Use `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2` (for balance)
- Optimize schema and indexes

---

## ‚úÖ Part 5: Schema Design & Architecture

### 21. **Normalization vs Denormalization**

- Normalize to reduce redundancy
- Denormalize for **read performance**
- Denormalize when:
  - Joins become too expensive
  - Read speed matters more than write consistency

---

### 22. **Zero-downtime schema migration**

- Use tools like **gh-ost**, **pt-online-schema-change**
- Strategy:
  - Create shadow table
  - Copy data in chunks
  - Swap tables
  - Update app code gradually

---

### 23. **Partitioning strategy**

- Use **range, list, hash** or **key partitioning**
- Example:

  ```sql
  PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(order_date))
  ```

- Avoid over-partitioning. Partitioning helps in **pruning**, not performance always.

---

### 24. **Too many foreign keys: Impact**

- Foreign keys add **overhead** during inserts/deletes.
- Slower replication (can‚Äôt be turned off on replicas)
- Consider removing FK constraints and **enforcing at application level**.

---

### 25. **When to choose MySQL vs NoSQL**

Use MySQL when:

- ACID is essential
- Relational data model
- Complex joins and reports

Use NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) when:

- Schema-less
- Rapid writes, scale-out
- Real-time analytics / search

---

## ‚úÖ Part 6: Monitoring, Scaling, Tuning

### 26. **Important metrics to monitor**

- `Queries per second (QPS)`
- `Slow query log`
- `Buffer pool hit ratio`
- `Replication lag`
- `Table locks`, `Temp tables`
- Disk/IO usage

Use: **Percona PMM**, **Grafana**, **performance_schema**

---

### 27. **Table fragmentation in InnoDB**

Caused by deletes/updates. Fix with:

```sql
OPTIMIZE TABLE tablename;
```

Or use `pt-online-schema-change` for live systems.

---

### 28. **Horizontal scaling of MySQL**

- **Read Scaling**: Replication with read/write split
- **Write Scaling**:
  - Sharding by user/tenant ID
  - Use Vitess, ProxySQL, or custom sharding layer

---

### 29. **Key performance configs**

- `innodb_buffer_pool_size` = biggest impact
- `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2` for perf
- `query_cache_size` (deprecated in 8.0)
- `tmp_table_size`, `sort_buffer_size`, `join_buffer_size`

---

### 30. **Experience with monitoring tools**

| Performance    | Better for write-heavy apps         | Faster for read-heavy tables      |

**Use InnoDB when:** you need transactions, foreign keys, and high concurrency.  
**Use MyISAM when:** you prioritize read performance and don't need transactions (e.g., reporting tables).

---

### üöÄ **2. How do you optimize a slow-running MySQL query?**

**Answer:**
1. **Use `EXPLAIN`** to analyze the execution plan.
2. **Add proper indexes** (especially on WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY columns).
3. **Avoid SELECT *** ‚Äì only fetch necessary columns.
4. **Use LIMIT for pagination**.
5. **Avoid functions on indexed columns**.
6. **Denormalize data** if necessary for complex joins.
7. **Check query cache and buffer settings**.
8. **Partition large tables** if needed.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **3. What are different types of indexing in MySQL?**

**Answer:**
- **Primary Index**: Unique index on the primary key.
- **Unique Index**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- **Composite Index**: Index on multiple columns.
- **Full-Text Index**: Used for full-text searching (MyISAM and InnoDB).
- **Spatial Index**: For spatial/GIS data types.
- **BTREE / HASH indexes**: Storage engine-specific.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **4. What is a covering index and when is it used?**

**Answer:**
A **covering index** is an index that includes **all the columns** required by a query. This avoids accessing the actual table data, improving performance.

Example:
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age = 30;
-- Index on (age, name) makes it a covering index
```

---

### üß† **5. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in execution and performance?**

**Answer:**
- **INNER JOIN** returns only matching rows in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right.

**Performance Tip:** INNER JOINs are generally faster because they return fewer rows and don't need to fill in NULLs for unmatched rows.

---

### üîê **6. How does MySQL handle isolation levels and what are the effects?**

**Answer:**
MySQL (InnoDB) supports:
- READ UNCOMMITTED ‚Äì Dirty reads allowed
- READ COMMITTED ‚Äì No dirty reads
- REPEATABLE READ (default) ‚Äì No non-repeatable reads
- SERIALIZABLE ‚Äì Full locking, most strict

**Trade-off:** Higher isolation = less concurrency, more locking.

---

### üìà **7. How do you handle large data migrations or ALTER TABLE on big tables in production?**

**Answer:**
- Use **pt-online-schema-change** (Percona Toolkit) or **gh-ost** to avoid downtime.
- Break migration into **small batches**.
- Perform during **off-peak hours**.
- Use **replication** to migrate on a replica first, then promote.
- Monitor for locks and query performance.

---

### üß© **8. What is a deadlock? How do you detect and resolve it in MySQL?**

**Answer:**
A **deadlock** happens when two or more transactions wait on each other indefinitely.

**Detection:**
```sql
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
```

**Resolution:**
- MySQL automatically rolls back one transaction.
- To prevent:
  - Access tables in the **same order**.
  - Keep transactions **short**.
  - Use **SELECT ... FOR UPDATE** carefully.

---

### üíæ **9. How does replication work in MySQL?**

**Answer:**
- **Asynchronous**: Master logs changes in binary logs ‚Üí Slave reads via I/O thread ‚Üí Applies using SQL thread.
- **Semi-Synchronous**: Master waits for at least one slave acknowledgment.
- **GTID-Based Replication**: Uses global transaction IDs for better failover and consistency.

**Use Cases:** Scaling reads, backups, disaster recovery.

---

### üßÆ **10. What‚Äôs the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes in MySQL?**

**Answer:**
- **Clustered Index (InnoDB)**: Primary key is the clustered index. Table data is stored **in the leaf nodes** of the index.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Secondary indexes store **pointers** to the primary key.

**Impact:** Having a well-designed primary key is crucial for performance in InnoDB.

---
Absolutely! Since you're aiming at **10+ years of MySQL experience**, here‚Äôs **more advanced** content beyond the basics‚Äîfocused on **real-world architecture, performance, and reliability**. These questions come up in **senior engineer**, **DBA**, and **tech lead** interviews.

---

### üß± **11. What is MySQL Query Execution Plan and how do you interpret it?**

**Answer:**
Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze how MySQL executes a query.

Look at:
- **type**: 'ALL' = full table scan (bad), 'index', 'range', 'ref', 'const', 'eq_ref', 'system' (best to worst).
- **key / key_len**: Index being used and its length.
- **rows**: Estimated rows to read.
- **Extra**: Watch for ‚ÄúUsing filesort‚Äù, ‚ÄúUsing temporary‚Äù ‚Äì they can signal performance issues.

---

### üßä **12. How do you handle MySQL high availability?**

**Answer:**
- **Replication + Failover tools**:
  - Native replication (GTID)
  - Tools: **MHA**, **Orchestrator**, **ProxySQL**, **Vitess**
- **Clustered DBs**:
  - **MySQL Group Replication**
  - **Galera Cluster**
  - **NDB Cluster**
- **Cloud-native options**: AWS Aurora, GCP CloudSQL with multi-zone failover

---

### ‚ö° **13. How do you handle replication lag?**

**Answer:**
- Tune **slave I/O and SQL threads**
- Optimize long-running queries on master
- Split heavy writes
- Use **row-based** replication (more efficient than statement-based in many cases)
- Check `Seconds_Behind_Master` and `performance_schema.replication_applier_status`

---

### üîÅ **14. What are the different replication formats?**

**Answer:**
1. **Statement-based** ‚Äì Sends SQL to slave; can cause inconsistencies.
2. **Row-based** ‚Äì Sends actual changed rows.
3. **Mixed** ‚Äì Auto-switches between the two.

**Best Practice:** Prefer **row-based** for accuracy.

---

### üß¨ **15. How do you handle schema versioning in a CI/CD pipeline?**

**Answer:**
- Use tools like **Flyway**, **Liquibase**, or **dbmate**
- Maintain versioned SQL migration scripts in Git
- Automate migration on deployment
- Ensure rollback scripts are available

---

### üîÑ **16. Difference between TEMPORARY tables, MEMORY tables, and derived tables?**

**Answer:**
- **TEMPORARY table**: Exists per session; stored on disk by default (or memory if small).
- **MEMORY table**: Lives in RAM; volatile.
- **Derived table**: Result of a subquery used as a temporary table in the query.

---

### üîç **17. What is the difference between logical and physical backup?**

**Answer:**
- **Logical**: `mysqldump`, `mysqlpump` (readable SQL files).
- **Physical**: `xtrabackup`, LVM snapshots (faster, includes data files).

**Best Practice:** Use **physical backup** for large datasets.

---

### üß™ **18. What are common MySQL bottlenecks and how do you identify them?**

**Answer:**
- **Slow Queries** ‚Üí Use `slow_query_log`

- **Disk I/O** ‚Üí Use `iostat`, monitor `Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests`
- **Lock Contention** ‚Üí `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`

---

### üìä **19. How do you monitor MySQL in production?**

**Answer:**
- Tools: **Percona Monitoring & Management (PMM)**, **Datadog**, **Zabbix**, **Prometheus + Grafana**
- Metrics to monitor:
  - Query latency
  - Connections
  - Replication delay
  - Disk/CPU/Memory
  - Table/Index fragmentation
  - Deadlocks

---

### üìà **20. What are histograms in MySQL?**

**Answer:**
Histograms help the optimizer estimate row counts when **column values are skewed**. Especially useful when indexes aren't available.

```sql
ANALYZE TABLE my_table UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON my_column;
```
